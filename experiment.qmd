# Experiment

Your assignment is to investigate the thermoelectric effects -- Seebeck and Peltier -- and write a lab report on your findings. You will be required to come up with your own experiment. However, it is recommended to follow through the guided exploration below first.

The experiment has two parts: the heat engine (Seebeck) and heat pump (Peltier).

This experiment uses the following equipment:

-   Peltier device

-   Alpha immersion thermostat w/ thermal bath

-   Two thermometers

-   4 multimeters

-   A power supply capable of running 0V → 18V DC (max current 5A) and stepped-down 2V → 15V AC voltage (max current 5A) simultaneously

-   A variable resistor (0Ω → 33Ω)

-   A basic resistor breadboard

-   Assorted resistors: (1.0 ± 2%) Ω, (2.0 ± 2%) Ω, (5.0 ± 5%) Ω, and (10.0 ± 2%) Ω

-   Cables

## Warning

The DC output of the power supply must only be used as an input for the Peltier Device. The AC output of the power supply must only be used as an input for the heating coil (maximum 4 V). To change the AC output, use the rheostat to change the reistance according to $V=IR%$.

## Warning

Because the thermostat is used as the hot reservoir (up to 80°C), please exercise caution to avoid burning yourself. Wear the provided gloves if handling any of the heated-up equipment.
