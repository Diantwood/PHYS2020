    "text": "1.1 History\nIn 1841, James Prescott Joule realised that an electric current has an inherent thermal effect, called the Joule effect (Martins 2022). Later in 1851, William Thomson realised that passing an electrical current through an unequally heated conductor released or absorbed heat depending on the direction of the heat and electrical currents and the type of material (Thomson 1856). The irreversible Joule effect is about two orders of magnitude larger than the reversible Thomson effect, but both occur simultaneously while a current passes through a material (Macia 2015). These thermoelectric effects make up the backbone for how we got to heat engines and heat pumps from thermoelectric materials.\nIt was Thomas Johann Seebeck who first observed that if you connect three homogenous conductors connected in series, each at a different temperature, an electric current flows around the closed circuit (Engel and Reid 2013). The circuit is known as thermoelectric (TE) circuit. Hence, the Seebeck effect describes the conversion of thermal energy into electrical energy in the form of an electrical current.\nThe Seebeck Voltage \\(\\Delta V_{S}\\) of a TE circuit is proportional to the temperature difference of \\(T_{H}\\) and \\(T_{C}\\) (Macia 2015)\n\\[\\Delta V_{s} = S\\Delta T \\tag{1.5}\\]\nwhere \\(S(T)\\) is a temperature dependent property of the junction materials, with units \\(VK^{- 1}\\).\nJean Charles Peltier reported that passing a current across a junction at thermal equilibrium caused it to absorb heat from the surroundings \\(\\left( \\Delta Q_{P} < 0 \\right)\\), while if you reversed the current the junction released heat to the environment \\(\\left( \\Delta Q_{P} < 0 \\right)\\) (Segrè 2004). This Peltier Effect was illustrated nicely by Friedrich Emil Lenz in 1838, who placed a drop of water on the junction of bismuth and antimony wires (Macia 2015). When Lenz passed a current through the junction, the water froze; then when Lenz reversed the current, the ice melted. This was the first demonstration of TE refrigeration. The Peltier Heat is proportional to current \\(I\\), duration \\(\\Delta t\\) of the current applied via\n\\[\\Delta Q_{P} = \\Pi(T)I\\Delta t \\tag{1.6}\\]\nWhere \\(\\Pi(T)\\) is called the Peltier coefficient (Engel and Reid 2013).\n\n\n\n\nEngel, Thomas, and Philip Reid. 2013.

    "text": "2.1 Thermoelectric Efficiency\nIn this experiment, all measurements will be in terms of power rather than energy. A thermoelectric generator is a type of heat engine, which means the efficiency is defined by the ratio\n\\[\\eta = \\frac{W}{\\dot{Q}_{H}}\\]\nwhere \\(W\\) is the power delivered to the external load and \\(\\dot{Q}_{H}\\) is the heat power (measured in W) entering the hot junction (source). However, some heat exits the engine at the cold junction (sink).\nThe overall Heat power \\(\\dot{Q}_{H} = \\dot{Q}_{P} + \\dot{Q}_{n}\\) can be expressed in the form\n\\[\\dot{Q}_{H}= IT_{H}\\left( S_{p} - S_{n} \\right) + \\kappa\\Delta T - \\frac{I^{2}}{2}r\\]\nwhere the first term is the reversible heat release, and the last two terms are irreversible: Fourier diffusion and the Joule effect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 7 (Advanced)\n\n\n\nAssume there are no irreversible effects, show that the expression \\(\\eta = W/\\dot{Q}_{H}\\) will reduce to the Carnot limit \\(\\eta_{c} = \\Delta T/T_{H}\\).\n\n\nA thermoelectric cooler’s performance can be analysed in a similar way to TEGs (as above). The difference lies in an external battery driving the electrons in the n-type leg and holes in the p-type leg away from the cold junction to the hot one. Hence, the heat power is determined by the opposite contributions stemming from Fourier flow and the Peltier effect. The electric power \\(W_{C}\\ \\)consumed by the battery feeding the thermocouple is given by\n\\[W_{C} = I\\Delta V + rI^{2}\\]\nThe efficiency is expressed in terms of the coefficient of performance (COP)\n\\[\\phi = \\frac{Q_{C}}{W_{C}}\\]\nNote a COP of 0 is the maximum cooling temperature difference a TEC can reach. A COP of infinity is the theoretical maximum efficiency.\n\n\n\n\nEngel, Thomas, and Philip Reid. 2013. Thermodynamics, Statistical Thermodynamics, & Kinetics. Book.

    "section": "4.1 Thermoelectric Generator (TEG)",
    "text": "4.1 Thermoelectric Generator (TEG)\nTo start, we’ll be looking at a thermoelectric generator (heat engine). In other words, we will look at how much electrical energy (power) is produced from the thermoelectric device at varying temperature differences of \\(T_{H}\\) and \\(T_{C}\\).\nConnect the Thermostat water bath to the TEG device, making sure that the black covering (on the TEG) is flush with the metal water container as to not leak water. Place both thermometers into the designated \\(T_{H}\\) and \\(T_{C}\\) holes (add thermo-paste into the hole for better thermal contact). Then connect a voltmeter (in parallel) and an ammeter (in series). Turn on the thermostat (hot reservoir) and allow for water to be pumped into the TEG. Also turn on the water pump in the large barrel. Both the cold reservoir (from the water barrel) and hot reservoir (thermostat bath) should be at room temperature to start. Note, if any, electrical energy is being produced from the TEG at \\(\\Delta T \\approx 0\\).\nLet’s first find the Seebeck coefficient. To do this, we will need to run our circuit without a load resistor. This circuit has approximately zero resistance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 1\n\n\n\nMeasure the no-load voltage and short-circuit current of the circuit (without a load resistor) at varying temperature differences up to \\(T_{H} = 60{^\\circ}C\\). Find the Seebeck coefficient of the semiconductor combination (Hint: there are 142 thermocouple elements connected in series within the device). You must include uncertainty propagation and an evaluation of your result. After plotting the measurements, what does this relationship tell us about the internal resistance of the TEG device? (Hint: consider Ohm’s law).\n\n\nNext, we will connect the rheostat (load resistor) with resistance \\(R\\) to the TEG (or the breadboard if you’re comfortable with it). Our goal here is to find the value of the internal resistance of the TEG device. The thermostat temperature should still be at \\(60{^\\circ}\\)C from the previous task. While not necessary for this part, it is a good idea to know what resistance your rheostat is set to at each measurement. However, we will only be measuring current and voltage here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 2\n\n\n\nMeasure the voltage and current of the circuit at a constant temperature difference (record your error/uncertainty) at different load resistances. Find the maximum Seebeck voltage \\(V(I = 0)\\), available at this temperature difference and the short circuit current \\(I_{s}(V = 0)\\), as well as the internal resistance of the TEG device. Propagate your uncertainties.\n\n\nFinally, we will be calculating the heat \\(\\dot{Q}_{H}\\) flowing through the generator in unit time according to \\(\\frac{dQ}{dt} = \\dot{Q}_{H} = m_{w}c_{w}\\left( \\frac{d\\Delta T}{dt} \\right)\\). And we’ll also calculate the electrical power, measured at constant load, \\(W\\). You will need to estimate the mass of the water \\(m_{w}\\) in the container.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 3\n\n\n\nSet the Rheostat resistance to equal the internal resistance of the TEG device (you found in Task 2). Record the temperature of both sides of the TEG device over time as you go from \\(60{^\\circ}C\\) to \\(80{^\\circ}C\\). Then turn off the thermostat heat bath and continue recording the temperature for the next 10-15 minutes as it cools. Record the current and voltage output at each increment too. Find the maximum efficiency \\(\\eta^{*}\\).\n\n\nSummary: We’ve observed how a thermoelectric device has operated as a heat engine. We’ve calculated the Seebeck Coefficient, the internal resistance of the TEG device, and used it to find the maximum efficiency of the device. We should know what properties a TEG device should have to run at an optimal level and what its drawbacks are."

    "section": "4.2 Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC)",
    "text": "4.2 Thermoelectric Cooler (TEC)\nFirst, let’s figure out which way we need to pass the current through the TEC to make it cool the correct side. Fix the water container with the hole in the top (for the heating coil) instead of the thermostat container. Fill it with room temperature water. Connect the TEC device to the power supply through the DC side. Turn it on. You should now see on the thermometers which side is heating up and which side is cooling down. Swap the positive/negative cables to make the heating-coil side cool down.\nNow add the heating coil (\\(R_{coil} \\approx 3\\Omega\\)) to the water container. Make sure it is submerged in the water and not touching the sides before turning it on. It must be connected to the AC and not higher than 3.5 A of current.\nOur goal is to calculate the cooling capacity \\(\\dot{Q}_{C}\\). A nifty way to do this is to match the cooling capacity with the heating of the coil. This means that the cooling effect of the Peltier is balancing out the heating of the coil. Hence, the temperature of both sides shouldn’t change.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask 4\n\n\n\nMatch the heating output of the heating coil with the cooling output of the TEC at multiple TEC current inputs, i.e., set the input DC current of the cooling device; match the heating coil input to achieve zero temperature difference by changing the resistance of the rheostat. Measure the heater current and voltage, the operating current and voltage, and the temperatures \\(T_{H}\\) and \\(T_{C}\\). Find the COP \\(\\phi\\) at multiple input DC currents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nStudents should check their progress with their tutors before proceeding any further."

    "text": "5.1 Heating and Cooling Efficiency\nIf you run the apparatus as a heat pump, you could investigate the maximum coefficient of performance that could be achieved, and what the main factors that limit this performance. To measure the COP, you will need to find a way to measure the power extracted from the cold reservoir or added to the hot reservoir (depending on whether you are interested in cooling the cold reservoir or heating the hot). Note this will be similar to Task 3.\nYou will need to know that the total heat capacity of the copper block, brass bath, and water is \\(C_{tot} \\approx 1100 \\pm 50\\frac{J}{kg\\ K}\\).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nQuestion 8 (Advanced)\n\n\n\nSimilar to the maximum efficiency for TEG devices, we can have a maximum efficiency for cooling. First show that if there were no irreversible transport effects, we get the efficiency is equivalent to the Carnot efficiency for cooling, \\(\\phi_{carnot} \\equiv T_{C}/\\Delta T\\). Then derive the optimal current value \\(I_{C}^{*}\\) by imposing the extremum condition \\(\\frac{dQ_{C}}{dI} = 0\\) on \\(\\dot{Q}_{C}\\). Hint: you should be able to figure out the expression of \\(Q_{C}\\) from Question 4 & 5. Then find the maximum COP \\(\\phi_{I}^{*} = Q_{C}^{*}/W_{C}\\) by imposing \\(\\frac{d\\phi}{dI}\\).
