A thermal gradient generates an electric current (TE generator, TEG) or a DC current is applied to remove heat from the cold side (TE cooler, TEC). Thermoelectric devices generally consist of a relative large number of thermocouples associated electrically in series and thermally in parallel.\n\n![A thermoelectric generator made of two thermocouples](images/thermocouple.png){#fig-thermocouple}\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Question 1\n\nWhere would you find TECs/TEGs in practice? What are the advantages of TE devices compared to other energy technologies? What are their drawbacks? Note: include your answer in the Introduction/Theory\n:::\n\nA thermocouple is formed by a n-type and a p-type thermoelement (in what is a called a leg or branch). A n-type leg or branch has length $L_{n}$ and cross-section $A_{n}$. The two legs are connected by a conductor at the hot end ($T_{H}$) that is assumed to have negligible electrical and thermal resistance. To close the circuit a load resistor, with a resistance $R$, is connected between the cold end of the thermoelements ($T_{C}$).\n\nThe temperature difference $T_{H} - T_{C} \\equiv \\Delta T > 0$ generates the Seebeck Voltage $\\Delta V = \\left( S_{p} - S_{n} \\right)\\Delta T$ at the hot junction, where $S_{p} > 0$ and $S_{n} < 0$ are the Seebeck coefficients of the p-type and n-type thermoelements, respectively [@RN2;@RN5]. The internal electrical resistance of the thermopile shown in @fig-thermocouple is\n\n$$r = 2\\left( \\frac{L_{n}}{\\sigma_{n}A_{n}} + \\frac{L_{p}}{\\sigma_{p}A_{p}} \\right)$$ {#eq-restherm}\n\nwhere $\\sigma_{n}$ and $\\sigma_{p}$ are the legs conductivities.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Question 2\n\nExplain how @eq-restherm has been derived. You need to recall connection of resistors in series and in parallel.\n:::\n\nFrom an electrical point of view, a thermoelectric generator can be replaced with a voltage source and a resistor in series. Therefore, the entire device shown in Figure 2 is equivalent to the electric circuit shown in @fig-circuit.\n\n![Equivalent electrical circuit for a thermoelectric generator.](images/circuit.png){#fig-circuit}\n\nThe electrical current in the circuit is\n\n$$I = \\frac{\\Delta V_{S}}{r + R}$$ {#eq-currentT}\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Question 3\n\nExplain how @eq-currentT is obtained.\n:::\n\nThe power delivered to external load is given by\n\n$$W = \\frac{{\\Delta V_{S}^{2}}R}{(r + R)^{2}}$$ {#eq-power}\n\nThis can also be written as\n\n$$W = I\\Delta V_{S} - rI^{2}$$ {#eq-poweral}\n\nwhere the first term can be interpreted as the electric power due to the Seebeck effect, and the second term is the power lost by Joule heating due to the internal resistance.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Question 4\n\nRecall how to calculate electrical power delivered to a resistor (this electrical power is converted back to heat but if the resistor is replaced by an electrical motor, it can be converted into work) and derive @eq-power and obtain @eq-poweral.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Question 5\n\nUse what you have learned in calculus about finding a maximum (minimum) of a function and obtain the maximum output power for a TE device.\n:::\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Question 6\n\nAssuming symmetry between thermocouple legs, derive the maximum output power in terms of the design parameters $A,\\ L$.\n:::\n\n## Thermoelectric Efficiency\n\nIn this experiment, all measurements will be in terms of power rather than energy. A thermoelectric generator is a type of heat engine, which means the efficiency is defined by the ratio\n\n$$\\eta = \\frac{W}{\\dot{Q}_{H}}$$\n\nwhere $W$ is the power delivered to the external load and $\\dot{Q}_{H}$ is the heat power (measured in W) entering the hot junction (source). However, some heat exits the engine at the cold junction (sink).\n\nThe overall Heat power $\\dot{Q}_{H} = \\dot{Q}_{P} + \\dot{Q}_{n}$ can be expressed in the form\n\n$$\\dot{Q}_{H}= IT_{H}\\left( S_{p} - S_{n} \\right) + \\kappa\\Delta T - \\frac{I^{2}}{2}r$$\n\nwhere the first term is the reversible heat release, and the last two terms are irreversible: Fourier diffusion and the Joule effect.\n\n::: {.callout-tip}\n## Question 7 (Advanced)\n\nAssume there are no irreversible effects, show that the expression $\\eta = W/\\dot{Q}_{H}$ will reduce to the Carnot limit $\\eta_{c} = \\Delta T/T_{H}$.\n:::\n\nA thermoelectric cooler's performance can be analysed in a similar way to TEGs (as above). The difference lies in an external battery driving the electrons in the n-type leg and holes in the p-type leg away from the cold junction to the hot one. Hence, the heat power is determined by the opposite contributions stemming from Fourier flow and the Peltier effect. The electric power $W_{C}\\ $consumed by the battery feeding the thermocouple is given by\n\n$$W_{C} = I\\Delta V + rI^{2}$$\n\nThe efficiency is expressed in terms of the coefficient of performance (COP)\n\n$$\\phi = \\frac{Q_{C}}{W_{C}}$$\n\nNote a COP of 0 is the maximum cooling temperature difference a TEC can reach. A COP of infinity is the theoretical maximum efficiency."},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","output-file":"TED.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.313","bibliography":["references.bib"],"theme":"cosmo"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}},"pdf":{"execute":{"fig-width":5.5,"fig-height":3.5,"fig-format":"pdf","fig-dpi":300,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":true,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"pdf","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":true,"merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"pdf-engine":"xelatex","standalone":true,"variables":{"graphics":true,"tables":true},"default-image-extension":"pdf","to":"pdf","toc":false,"number-sections":true,"output-file":"TED.pdf"},"language":{},"metadata":{"block-headings":true,"bibliography":["references.bib"],"documentclass":"scrreprt","colorlinks":true},"extensions":{"book":{}}}}}
